# Scramble
http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/Cmabrigde/

An attempt to disprove the very annoying forward about how spelling doesn't matter as long as the first and last letters remain intact in a word by,

1. presenting individual words without context (this is also much easier for me)

2. scrambling the letters randomly and alphabetically inside
I am also interested in analysing my own performance in the two different types of scrambling.
